      This chapter focuses on difference between &nm; and <command>wicked</command> and also gives a description how to switch from <command>wicked</command> to &nm;.

<para>
  &nm; is a program that manages the primary network connection and other connection interfaces. &nm; has been designed to be fully automatic by default. &nm; is handled by &systemd; and is shipped with all necessary service unit files.

  <title>Differences between &nm; and <command>wicked</command></title>
  <para>
    Even though &nm; and <command>wicked</command> provide similar functionality, they differ in the following points:
  </para>

  <variablelist>
   <varlistentry>
    <term>&rootuser; privileges</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      If you use &nm; for network setup, you can easily switch, stop or
      start your network connection at any time. &nm; also makes it possible to change
      and configure wireless card connections without requiring
      &rootuser; privileges. 
     </para>
     <para>
      <command>wicked</command> also provides some ways to switch, stop or
      start the connection with or without user intervention, like
      user-managed devices. However, this always requires &rootuser;
      privileges to change or configure a network device.

    <term>Types of network connections</term>
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Both <command>wicked</command> and &nm; can handle network
      connections with a wireless network (with WEP, WPA-PSK, and
      WPA-Enterprise access) and wired networks using DHCP and static
      configuration. They also support connection through dial-up and VPN.
      With &nm; you can also connect a mobile broadband (3G) modem
      or set up a DSL connection, which is not possible with the traditional
      configuration.
     </para>
     <para>
      &nm; tries to keep your computer connected at all times using the
      best connection available. If the network cable is accidentally
      disconnected, it tries to reconnect. &nm; can find the network with the
      best signal strength from the list of your wireless connections and
      automatically use it to connect. To get the same functionality with
      <command>wicked</command>, more configuration effort is required.

        Some k8s plugins require &nm; to run and are not compatible with <command>wicked</command>.
